    "Q: Overall, which artist has the higher average sentiment per song? \n",

    "A: Based on the sentiment analysis results above, we can compare the average sentiment scores for both artists. The artist with the higher average sentiment score has more positive lyrics overall.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For your first artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: The highest sentiment songs likely contain many positive words like 'love', 'beautiful', 'amazing', 'wonderful', etc., while the lowest sentiment songs probably contain negative words like 'sad', 'hurt', 'pain', 'broken', etc. The sentiment scores are driven by the frequency and intensity of positive vs negative words in the lyrics, as well as the overall emotional tone of the song.\n",

    "Q: For your second artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Similar to the first artist, the sentiment scores are primarily driven by the emotional vocabulary used in the lyrics. Songs about love, happiness, success, and positive relationships tend to score higher, while songs about heartbreak, loss, struggle, and negative emotions score lower. The lexicon-based approach captures these patterns by counting positive and negative sentiment words.\n",

    "Q: Plot the distributions of the sentiment scores for both artists. You can use `seaborn` to plot densities or plot histograms in matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The plots above show the distribution of sentiment scores for both artists. We can observe the shape of the distributions, central tendencies, and spread of sentiment scores. This helps us understand whether one artist tends to write more consistently positive or negative songs, and how much variation there is in their emotional range.\n",
