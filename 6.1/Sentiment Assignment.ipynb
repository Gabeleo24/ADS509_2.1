    "Q: For your first artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: The highest sentiment songs likely contain many positive words like 'love', 'beautiful', 'amazing', 'wonderful', etc., while the lowest sentiment songs probably contain negative words like 'sad', 'hurt', 'pain', 'broken', etc. The sentiment scores are driven by the frequency and intensity of positive vs negative words in the lyrics, as well as the overall emotional tone of the song.\n",

    "Q: For your second artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Similar to the first artist, the sentiment scores are primarily driven by the emotional vocabulary used in the lyrics. Songs about love, happiness, success, and positive relationships tend to score higher, while songs about heartbreak, loss, struggle, and negative emotions score lower. The lexicon-based approach captures these patterns by counting positive and negative sentiment words.\n",
