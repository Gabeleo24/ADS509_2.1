# ADS 509: Advanced Text Mining Projects

A comprehensive collection of text analysis projects for ADS 509, featuring comparative text analysis, political text classification, and topic modeling using advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Project Description

This repository contains assignments for ADS 509 Modules 3, 4, and 5:

### Module 3: Group Comparison
Comparative text analysis project analyzing two distinct text corpora for each artist (Robyn and Cher):
- **Lyrics data**: Song lyrics from both artists
- **Twitter data**: Follower descriptions from each artist's Twitter account

The analysis employs various NLP techniques including tokenization, normalization, stopword removal, and statistical comparison to identify patterns and differences between the text groups.

### Module 4: Political Naive Bayes
Political text classification project using Naive Bayes algorithms to analyze and classify political content:
- **Convention speeches**: 2020 Democratic and Republican convention speeches
- **Congressional tweets**: Twitter data from congressional candidates

This module demonstrates machine learning classification techniques, feature extraction, and political text analysis using supervised learning methods.

### Assignment 5.1: Topic Modeling
Advanced topic modeling project comparing three different approaches to discover latent topics in text:
- **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**: Linear algebraic approach to topic modeling
- **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)**: Dimensionality reduction using SVD for topic discovery
- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**: Probabilistic topic modeling with Dirichlet distributions

This assignment uses the Brown University corpus from NLTK to compare topic modeling approaches and evaluate their effectiveness against known document categories.
